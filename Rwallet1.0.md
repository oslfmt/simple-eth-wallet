## The simplist (ETH) wallet

This wallet is incredibly simple. Upon signup, it creates a single key pair
for the user, which is then used for any and all further transactions made
by this account. It is a step below JBOK, since it is only 1 key and address,
and is a nightmare for privacy.

However, it accomplishes the basic requirements that a wallet must fulfill.
The user can query their balance, and send transactions to anyone else.
Anyone can send funds to them.
